    "# PE101-01: Using Python Packages and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "By itself, Python provides everything you need to write programs. These programs won't have a fancy user interface and they may not run very fast, but they'll work. If that's all Python offered, it might have become a popular language but it wouldn't have taken over most of the world the way it has. No, what Python has going for it is a simple way to take commonly-used chunks of code, wrap them up neatly into sharable budles, and distribute those bundles far and wide. The mechanism for doing this in Python is called **packages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this training unit, PE101-01, we're going to look at some of the packages that come with Python. These are packages that you can count on being available anywhere you can run Python. In the next unit, PE101-02, we'll look at how to find and use packages hosted in _repositories_ available to anyone but not necessarily already installed where you're running your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is, by itself, a rather simple language. The PE100 series of units has introduced you to almost all of the language. The language is kept small by moving the \"nice to have, but not really necessary\" parts into their own independent packages. Let's start with an example:"

This tells the Python interpreter to find the package named \"math\" and to open it up and make its contents available to this session. The things in the package we can get to will all be named by the word \"math\", a period, and then the name of the actual part of the package to use. We would say the package \"math\" is imported into the \"math namespace\". This is the default behavior, but we can change that. Indeed:"

Package and module names are separated by periods. Let's take a look..."
