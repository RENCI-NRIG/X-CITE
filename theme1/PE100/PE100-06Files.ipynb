    "You can write a good deal of software that runs entirely inside Jupyter notebooks or that runs on the command line and only communicates through the screen and the keyboard. Sometimes, though, you have to do with files. It may not be practical to hardcode all your data into assignment statements in Python, or maybe you have to deal with a number of files and therefore you can't use pipes. **link to Sys Fundamentals page here**\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen two basic ways to do Input and Output (often referred to as \"I/O\"). We've used `input()` to read from the keyboard and `print()` to send output to the screen. Those functions work quite well, except you might have to do a lot of typing or deal with your output scrolling off the screen. In neither case is the data *durable* - it goes away as soon as the program is done or you close the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `input()` and `print()` functions are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg in terms of getting information in and out of running Python code. Some of our other options include:\n",
    "* GUI controls: text box, menu, dialog box...\n",

    "## Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically everyone is more-or-less familiar with the idea of a file, even if fairly few people know how they work. We're going to ignore a **lot** of details for the moment and say this: a file is a long-lasting collection of bytes. It has a first byte, a last byte, and every one in between stays in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This begs the question \"What is a byte?\"  A byte is just a small number from 0 to 255 (inclusive). We can assign meaning to those numbers, and if we're smart about how we do it then we can represent any information a computer can process as long as we use enough of these bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We like to think of files as being one of two types: binary files and text files. Binary files are pure data. We decide how to write bytes to a file to represent data. Then when we're ready to read it in again, we read the bytes, process them somehow, and reconstruct the original data. It's a great technique - it's fast and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't be talking about binary files in this notebook or even in this module. Fifteen years ago we wouldn't have had a choice, we would have had to. These days, it's unusual to have to deal with binary files, especially in Python, because there is so often a library function already available to do the work for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text files, on the other hand, are probably something you're already familar with - they are what you get when you edit a \"plain text\" file in \"notepad\" or \"textedit\". In a text file, every one of the letter, number, and punctuation mark characters is assigned its own number. For instance, capital \"A\" is 65. \"B\" is 66. [Not that it should ever matter, but here's a complete list and then some!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you open an editor and type \"CAT\". When you save that to a file, there will be a file that is three bytes long and contains the three bytes 67, 65, and 84. Actually there will usually be a fourth byte, 10, which is the character you get when you press \"Enter\" or \"Return\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, at least for a few minutes, we're going to pretend the only language on earth is English. We'll talk about other languages when we talk about networks.\n",

Then in the second argument we specified \"w\", meaning we wanted to write to the file. The \"w\" mode will cause the file to be created if it didn't already exist.
