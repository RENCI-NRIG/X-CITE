Suppose we're looking at absorption at one specific wavelength and we know that some of our instruments are a little bit too sensitive to changes in humidity. Maybe the first spectrometer has some insulation that is just a little too porous and reads a bit high, but the second one is even worse. We have calibration constants we can apply, but we have to apply the right constant for each individual instrument."
