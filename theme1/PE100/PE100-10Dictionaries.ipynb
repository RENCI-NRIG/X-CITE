    "Dictionaries are, conceptually, a special type of list. A list has an order to it. Elements are placed into a list in a particular order. Removing and inserting items changes the order in a well understood way. Because of this, yoiu can always access a list by looking into it at a specific integer index.  None of this is possible with a dictionary. Instead, dictionaries have a better trick: all access is by searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's dictionaries store each of their elements as a pair of things, a *key* and a *value*. The key is the thing that can be searched for, and the value is the information that will be retured when that element is read.\n",

    "Let's take that apart and see how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have the creation of the dictionary itself. We create a dictionary literal much like we do a list, only here we use curly brackets instead of square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We have key:value pairs. The keys we're using are all strings (people's names, in fact) but they could just as well be numbers. The values are also strings, but they can be anything we want. These keys and values are separated by colons (`:`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Between each of the key:value pairs there is a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We see how to look up information in a dictionary. It looks like indexing into a list to extract a particular element, except in this case we don't give a positional index number but rather we give it a key to look up.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think about it, looking for Bob's favorite food by using `favorite_food[\"Bob\"]` is a pretty powerful tool. Rather than having to specify *where* to get something from, we can just specify *what* to get. This is why you'll occasionally see dictionaries refered to as \"Content Addressable Memory\". It's nice to just get the data we want without having to step through every element of a list looking for it. It's also faster: Python's dictionaries use clever indexing so they can straight to what you're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries get their name, by the way, from real-world physical dictionaries. Suppose you have Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary in front of you. There are a lot of keys in there - each one of those words in alphabetical order is a key. There's not really any way to look up something by page number alone - there's no algorithm to tell me what page the definition for brisance is on. There's no way to look up a word by knowing which word number it is. If brisance is the 8000th word in the dictionary, that knowledge does me no good. On the other hand, there is an algorithm for finding that definition by looking up the key word. I go to the \"B\"s, look for the \"Br\" part, and so forth until I find brisance. I can only look up things by key, not by position.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great things about Python is its flexibility with data types. Lists can contain any data type. You can have lists of tuples of lists of strings if you want to. Dictionaries are similarly versatile. You can have dictionaries that contain, say, lists:"
