A note about the diagrams:

Quarto supports embedding both mermaid and graphviz diagrams:

https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html


The .mmd files in this directory are input for mermaid, and the .dot
files are input for graphviz.  The .ditaa files are input for ditaa:

https://github.com/stathissideris/ditaa

Since I wanted a little more control over the layout of the nodes in
the diagram, I eventually chose ditaa.  The .mmd files and .dot files
are left here, just in case they are found to be eventually useful.
