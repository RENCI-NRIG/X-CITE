    "The above code defines a function named \"inductiveReactance\" that accepts two input parameters. The first one, l, is the amount of inductance a coil has in henrys. The second one, f, is the frequency of interest (in hertz). We can call that function with parameters of one millihenry and two megahertz. The function computes the value 12566.36 (the unit is ohms) and returns that to the code that called it. In this case, it was a print statement that called it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the first line. The very first thing is the keyword `def` (shortened from the word \"define\"). After the \"def\" is where you specify the name of the new function you want to create. In this case, it's \"inductiveReactance\". Next is a list of names of parameters, enclosed in parentheses. In our example, the parameters are \"l\" and \"f\". Finally at the end of the line is a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that first line is done, the next step is to write the body of the function. Just like an \"if\", \"while\", or \"for\" statement, the code block has to be indented consistently. Our example function computes the reactance of the device in question. On the last line of the function, the `return` statement is how the function sends its computed value back to the code that called the function in the first place. Every function should have at least one return statement. I won't get drawn into this debate: some say a function should have precisely one return statement and utilize whatever logical means necessary to make sure that all code paths eventually lead to it. Others say it's not a problem at all for a function to have multiple return statements (and hence multiple ways for a function to end) if it makes the logic more understandable. Personally, I try to minimize the number of return statements in my functions but I'm by no means a zealot on this one. If I need seven different places to exit the function and return a value then so be it.\n",

    "Functions are useful in programming for the same reason they're useful in math - ours *encapsulate* a chunk of code so you don't have to think about what is in it every time. Imagine how tedious it would be to write a program that needed to compute cosine in a lot of different places in the code. You could, I suppose, type in a Taylor series expansion for cosine in each of the places where we need to compute a cosign. That would be irritating, error prone, and confusing to anyone else who has to read it. Instead, we can write a function exactly once to compute cosine and then call that function from many places in our code. Once we have the function tested and debugged, we don't have to think about it again. That frees up mental energy for more productive uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be classified into one of two types. *Void Functions* exist for encapsulation and don't actually return a value. `print()` is an example of a void function. *Value-Returning Functions*, as the name strongly implies, return a value to the calling code. `inductiveReactance()` is an example of one.\n",
    "\n",

    "Does that seem odd to you?  What happened is this: four lines from the bottom we created a variable named \"wavelength\" and set it to 20. We then called the function to print it out doubled. We passed the global variable \"wavelength\" to our function which took it as its only argument. That argument became a parameter variable that was coincidentally named \"wavelength\". **That \"wavelength\" parameter variable has nothing to do with the \"wavelength\" variable in the main part of the program**. Our function doubles that parameter variable and prints it out. At that point, the function completes and the flow of control goes back to the main body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next time our function is called an entirely new, fresh set of variables and parameter variables is created. This is important - it means that if we call the function with the same value every time then we always get the same result. Functions are unable to save their \"state\". Like a football player on a stretcher, they have no memory of what happened before.\n",
    "\n",
    "(OK, yes, there are ways for them to save their state. Sometimes it's unavoidable and you just have to do it, but doing so makes more places for bugs to creep into your programs and makes it harder to understand later. Try to avoid it. We'll talk about it later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree to which your programs can \"see\" a variable is called *scope*. There are two levels of scope in most Python programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Global Scope\n",
    "    * Defined in main Python file\n",
    "    * Outside of ANY function\n",
    "    * **Try to avoid these!**\n",
    "        * Considered poor design\n",
    "        * Dangerous to use: any part of the program anywhere can change these\n",
    "        * Bug Magnet! \n",
    "* Local Scope\n",
    "    * Variables defined within a function\n",
    "    * Only visible and useable from inside their own function!\n",
    "    * Use these if at all possible.\n",
    " \n",
    "The danger in global variables comes from two things. The first is the fact that the value can be changed anywhere in your program, either in the main program or inside of a function, and it's devilishly hard to keep track of where that might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second danger is more subtle. When a function saves a value into a global variable, the function is now said to have *side effects*. Side effects break the idea of isolation that functions are meant to give us. Imagine a mathematical function, such as tangent, if it had side effects. Calling `tan(.0125)` would not only result in the tangent of .0125, but it would have some other effect on some unrelated part of math. Imagine if calling `tan` caused your coordinate system to change every time? That would be insane.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets worse, though. What if our tangent function also read from a global variable and changed its behavior based on that. Then each time we called `tan(.0125)` we might get a different value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we basically broke math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, when we write programs, if our functions have side effects then we've complicated them *tremendously*. And more complication means more places for bugs to sneak into our code and they'll also be harder to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, there is a style of programming that eliminates global variables and, to an extent, even local variables. It's called *functional* programming, and Python has some support for that style. There is usually more than one way to do anything in Python, and experienced Pythonistas will usually try to choose the most *Pythonic* way. Part of being in Pythonic style means to use (at least partially) a functional style. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an exception to the \"no globals\" rule: *Constants*.  Just like in math, a constant is given a value once and never changed again. \"Never changing\" means \"no side effects\" so everything is OK. It is good practice to define your constants using ALL CAPITAL LETTERS."

A consequence of that is their ability to \"hide\" detail from us. We've already talked about writing a function, debugging it, and never having to look at the code inside of it again. What is every bit as useful, if not more so, is using functions to provide *abstraction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is something we've used every day even if we haven't thought it. Remember learning math? You started off counting things, and yes, that counts as math. If you had four bottle caps in one hand and three in the other, you could toss them all on the table, count them, and know that you have seven in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two problems with having to count everything. One is that the amount of stuff can get big in a hurry. Try using two hands and table to count sand grains. The other problem is that if there are any insights to be had, it's hard to find them when you're stuck down in the details.  Fortunately, we learned arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic is great. We don't have to deal with handfuls of stuff anymore. We can just use *numbers* and *operators* and get an answer without a bunch of messing around. We can start to see patterns we never would have just tossing bottle caps on the table. If we need to add 12 to something, we can instead add 10 and then add 2 more. This is **so** handy. Of course, it would be nice if we could just do something to analyze *entire families* of arithmetic problems.\n",

And secondly, just looking at the output we can see that there are a lot more digits than when we did something by hand in our Inductive Impedance example (top of this page). In general, using a module that was (a) written by someone else and (b) is widely used and has been checked by a lot of people is going to avoid a lot of bugs. For instance, I would never code my own Fast Fourier Transform. Instead, I would use the one in the \"numpy\" module. I know how easy it is to make a mistake and I trust their work a lot more than my own. They have tens or hundreds of thousands of users and scores of developers. I have... a copy of *Numerical Recipes* that's old enough to run for President.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we used the \"math\" module already, here's a very incomplete list of what is in there:\n",
    "* sin(), cos(), tan(), acos(), asin(), atan()... - \"acos\" is \"arc cosine\", etc.\n",
    "* log(), log10(), sqrt() - square root\n",
    "* radians(), degrees() - converts between them\n",
    "\n",
    "And lots more stuff. How do you know what's in it?  Go to the online documentation: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)\n",

    "### Random Numbers\n",

    "Another module that is heavily used is \"random\". It generates random numbers, yes, but it can also do things like take a list of things and shuffle them randomly. \n"
