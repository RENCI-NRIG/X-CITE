# Basic / on-the-fly data analysis, viewing detector images

The following hands-on exercises demonstrate various methods of
analyzing and viewing x-ray detector images. All exercises (except the last one)
require an activated CLASSE account and access to the CLASSE
JupyterHub.

0. Basic skills:
   - [Linux at CHESS](https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/X-CITE/blob/main/theme4/XS101/linux-exercises.md)
   - [Python programming at CHESS](https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/X-CITE/blob/main/theme4/XS101/python-exercises.md)
   - Skills: Linux command line, navigating CHESS filesystms, Python

2. Low complexity: [Azimuthal integration of 2D diffraction
   patterns](https://github.com/CHESSComputing/CHAP-Training-Examples-Materials/tree/main/example_01)
   
   - Skills: CHAP, Python, Linux command line, navigating CHESS
     filesystems, Jupyter notebooks, matplotlib
      
3. Medium complexity: [Tomographic
   reconstruction](https://github.com/CHESSComputing/CHAP-Training-Examples-Materials/tree/main/example_02)
   
   - Skills: CHAP, Python, Linux command line, navigating CHESS
     filesystems, NoMachine, NeXpy, Galaxy
      
5. Low complexity: [Browser-based data visualization
   dashboard](http://services.nationalsciencedatafabric.org/chess/)
   
   - Practice choosing a dataset, navigating through an image stack,
     zooming in and out, changing the color palette, switching
     between lin/log scale, dropping probes in multiple locations
   - Skills: Examining detector images
