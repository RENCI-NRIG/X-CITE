Welcome to Systems Fundamentals! In this section, we're going to
learn some of how to use the computing resources available at CHESS.
There is a pool of servers all running Linux available for your use.
Whether you're writing code for simulation or using pre-existing
software for data reduction and analysis, you'll soon have a
visceral understanding of why computing is being called The Third
Pillar of Science (if you don't already).

There is a lot of material to cover, and in truth we'll still just be scratching the surface.
The goal here is to give you enough information to get started and
to find more information as you need it. We recommend you explore each of
the following sections in order.

- [Getting Started (logging in and out with NoMachine and ssh)][getting-started]
- Command Line Basics
- Writing Standalone Python Programs
- How Linux Really Works

Let's get started, shall we? Go ahead, click on the link for Getting Started, and
we'll get connected to the servers.
