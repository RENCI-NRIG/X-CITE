## What is Data?

<!-- TODO -->

Mirriam-Webster dictionary defines [data][webster-data] as _"factual
information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for
reasoning, discussion, or calculation"_ or _"information in digital
form that can be transmitted or processed."_

Wikipedia defines [data][wikipedia-data] as _"a collection of discrete
or continuous values that convey information, describing the quantity,
quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply
sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally."_

For our purposes, let us use the simple definition: it is information
in digital form that can be stored, transmitted, or processed.  Our
experiments may consume data, and they produce data.  We store this
data somewhere, for eventual use and/or sharing.
