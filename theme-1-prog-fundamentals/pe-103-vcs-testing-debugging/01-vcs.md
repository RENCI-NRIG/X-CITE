# Version control

## What is it?

Version control systems are software tools that are used to track
changes to source code or other collections of files.

Some well-known version control systems include: Git, Mercurial,
Subversion, Darcs, Fossil, CVS, and several proprietary systems.  Each
of them vary in practical usage and in implementation details.

Today Git is the most popular one, and seem to have "won", so Git is
what we will be discussing here.

## Why do we need it?

When you work on a project, you often will want to save the state of
your code at various points, such that you can go back and forth
between these various points.  When you work on a project as part of a
team, you will also want to know who wrote some part of the code,
when, and why.

Whether you work alone or in a team, using a version control system
will help you achieve the above goals.

In the absence of a version control system, you will often will end up
with a chaotic mess which achieves the above goals in a poorer manner.
You will likely resort to several almost-same-but-not-quite files
variously named like so:

- `notebook.ipynb`
- `notebook-2024-05-01.ipynb`
- `notebook-working.ipynb`
- `notebook-test.ipynb`

This scheme is basically a messy reinvention of a version control
system.  That might work in the simple cases, but it will soon break
down as you do more work on your project.

Instead, what you want to do is learn to use a version control system
properly.  You want to avoid the cognitive overload of dealing with
messy schemes based on filenames.
